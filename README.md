# 100-Days-of-Code
## Hey There ðŸ‘‹
I just started learning python from *Angela Yu's* course *100 Days of Code:The Complete Python Pro Bootcamp*. I will try to learn and update this repo everyday. I will be sharing the solutions of the excercises and projects of each day in this repository. If you wanna join, I am open to collaborate and complete this journey with more fellows.

If you liked my work, don't forget to give it a star.
